## 📖 Usage

### Starting a Work Session

1. Click the **Play** button to start tracking time
2. The timer will count up and show your remaining time to reach the daily target
3. Click **Pause** to temporarily stop the timer
4. Use **Adjust** to manually add or remove time

### Saving Sessions

1. Click the **Save** button
2. Enter a custom name for your session (e.g., "Frontend Development")
3. Confirm to save - the session is added to your history

### Tracking Your Streak

- Your streak shows consecutive days where you've reached your daily target
- Weekends are included in the streak calculation
- Missing a day resets your streak to 0

### Troubleshooting

#### macOS: "App is damaged" or "Cannot be opened"
If you see an error saying the app is damaged or cannot be opened, run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Workflow.app
```

### Viewing History

1. Click on the **Logged** card on the main screen
2. Browse your past sessions grouped by week
3. Use filters to find specific sessions
4. Edit or delete sessions as needed
